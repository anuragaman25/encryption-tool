# text_encryption
The Text Encryption Tool is a Python-based command-line program for secure encryption and decryption of text and files. It leverages the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM), a modern encryption standard that ensures both confidentiality (data remains secret) and integrity (prevents tampering).
